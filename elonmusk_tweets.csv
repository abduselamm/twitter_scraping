32,2019-12-30 06:57:24+00:00,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction."

We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area.

4982,2018-01-28 06:40:23+00:00,elonmusk,You‚Äôd need millions of zombies for a so-called ‚Äúapocalypse‚Äù anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
4983,2018-01-28 06:03:40+00:00,elonmusk,The rumor that I‚Äôm secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
4984,2018-01-28 06:00:22+00:00,elonmusk,@franke @boringcompany Good thing you didn‚Äôt ask about the Freezegun ...
4985,2018-01-28 06:00:21+00:00,elonmusk,@franke @boringcompany Hmmm
4986,2018-01-28 04:52:25+00:00,elonmusk,Unless you like fun
4987,2018-01-28 04:26:25+00:00,elonmusk,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don‚Äôt buy one."
4988,2018-01-28 03:07:40+00:00,elonmusk,"1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!"
4989,2018-01-28 02:35:25+00:00,elonmusk,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you‚Äôll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
4990,2018-01-28 01:32:18+00:00,elonmusk,Don‚Äôt do this https://t.co/e0q6ax60k5
4991,2018-01-28 01:14:11+00:00,elonmusk,@MKBHD ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I‚Äôd be way more scared of a steak knife.

4995,2018-01-27 21:15:29+00:00,elonmusk,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
4996,2018-01-24 18:35:00+00:00,elonmusk,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so. https://t.co/npaqatbNir
4997,2018-01-18 19:32:56+00:00,elonmusk,@sallyshin Check https://t.co/Il3CWSTPXR for updates
4998,2018-01-15 04:07:05+00:00,elonmusk,@Davidburrusdds Done
4999,2018-01-15 03:53:50+00:00,elonmusk,"@thenosyt Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
